								<br> I am currently exploring the atmospheric chemistry of ultra hot Jupiter, TOI-1518 b using high-resolution emission spectroscopy from the PEPSI spectrograph of the Large Binocular Telescope. I will soon be publishing our results from our atmospheric retrieval analysis, so stay tuned!

								<b>Multiplicity Statistics of Stars in the Sagittarius Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy: Comparison to the Milky Way</b><br>
								We use time-resolved spectra from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) to examine the distribution of radial velocity (RV)
								variations a sample of stars identified as members of the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxy by Hayes et al. (2020) and compare this distribution
								to stars from the Milky Way (MW) that have the stellar parameters (log(g), Teff , and [Fe/H]) similar to those of the Sagittarius members.
								We find that the shape of the distribution of RV shifts in Sgr dSph stars is similar to that measured in their MW analogs, but the total fraction 
								of RV variable stars in the Sgr dSph is larger by a factor of ~2, concluding that the fraction of close binaries in the Sgr dSph is intrinsically higher than in the MW.

								<!--I am a firm believer that science communication is just as important as the research itself! 
								In order to support current sciencists and foster the communinity of future 
								scientists/science enthusiasts, it is crucial to be able to communicate the importance of science at all levels of understanding. I've done advocacy work with
								the American Astronomical Society <a href="https://aas.org/advocacy">(AAS)</a>, where I've spoken with memebers of congress about the importance of funding programs like
								NASA and the NSF, as well as the importance for the protection of our skies from  
								<a href="https://aas.org/sites/default/files/2022-06/Satcon%20Leave-Behind%20Final.pdf">satellite constellations</a>, which will significantly threatens astronomy unless
								mitigating actions are taken. I also participate in outreach activities to help educate the public on science, including Astronomy on Tap
								<a href="https://astronomyontap.org/locations/pittsburgh-pa/">(AoT)</a> Pittsburgh. -->
